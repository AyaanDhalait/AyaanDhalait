# Ayaan Dhalait

Hi there, Howdy, Heya, I am Ayaan Dhalait (Ayaan D. for short).

## About Me

I am a computer programmer and aspiring engineer. I explore advanced computer science and physics topics, including quantum mechanics, algorithms, and simulations. I enjoy building projects that combine creativity and technology, like a VR solar system simulation for which I wrote a detailed article. My goal is to learn, experiment, and innovate while sharing my journey and insights in science and tech.
